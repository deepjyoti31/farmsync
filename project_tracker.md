## User Interface

The application features a modern, responsive UI with:

- Dashboard with quick access to important information
- Dedicated pages for each major feature (Farms, Fields, Crops, Livestock, etc.)
- Interactive forms for data entry
- Data tables for information display
- Cards and widgets for summarized information
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Farm Boundaries**: Uses Mapbox GL and MapboxDraw to allow users to draw polygons representing farm boundaries. The boundaries are stored as GeoJSON in the database.

2. **Area Calculation**: Automatically calculates area from GeoJSON polygons using the @mapbox/geojson-area library, with support for different units (acres, hectares, square meters).

3. **Weather Integration**: Fetches weather data from WeatherAPI.com through Supabase Edge Functions, displaying current conditions and forecasts.

4. **Authentication Flow**: Complete authentication system with sign-up, sign-in, and profile management.

5. **Data Management**: Uses React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.

## Design Decisions

1. **When adding a farm**: Users should mark the farm boundaries before the farm is added to the database. The area is automatically calculated from the marked boundaries rather than manually entered.

2. **Farm details display**: In the farm details dialog, the map is displayed on the right side and farm information with icons on the left side for better design.

3. **Mapping technology**: Mapbox is used for mapping functionality instead of other mapping libraries.

4. **Review section**: When adding a farm, the area, longitude, and latitude are displayed in the review section, calculated from the marked farm boundaries on the map.

5. **UI organization**: When adding a farm, users see the details and map in one section rather than separate tabs.

6. **Field card design**: Field cards display the parent farm name instead of "No location specified" for better context. Cards use a compact layout with appropriate icons and well-positioned action buttons.

7. **Crop categorization**: When adding a crop, users first select a category (vegetables, fruits, cereals, flowers) and then choose from a filtered list of crops within that category.

8. **Field selection by farm**: When selecting a field for a crop, fields are grouped by their parent farm for better organization and context.

9. **Automatic harvest date calculation**: Based on the selected crop and planting date, the system automatically calculates the expected harvest date while keeping it editable for user adjustments.

10. **Field creation accessibility**: Add Field buttons are placed in multiple strategic locations (Farms page, farm details dialog) to reduce navigation steps.

11. **Authentication notifications**: Authentication success messages are only shown for explicit user actions (login, logout) and not for automatic session refreshes or browser minimization.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Dialog Component Structure
- **Issue**: In the Fields page, the "Add New Field" dialog was appearing nested inside another dialog-like container, creating a poor user experience.
- **Solution**:
  - Restructured the AddFieldForm component to remove dialog-like styling (rounded corners, shadows)
  - Created a wrapper component (FieldsListWithDialog) to manage dialog state and rendering
  - Simplified the Fields page structure to avoid unnecessary nesting
  - Ensured consistent dialog implementation across the application
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent user experience across all dialogs in the application
  - Cleaner component hierarchy with better separation of concerns
  - Improved maintainability with a standardized approach to dialog implementation

### 2. Field Card Redesign
- **Issue**: Field cards had a large icon taking up space, showed redundant information, and had overlapping edit/delete buttons.
- **Solution**:
  - Redesigned field cards with a more compact and informative layout
  - Replaced the large icon with a smaller, more appropriate icon (LandPlot)
  - Added edit functionality directly in the card header
  - Improved the positioning of action buttons to prevent overlap
  - Removed redundant information (soil type was shown twice)
  - Created a dedicated EditFieldForm component for editing fields
  - Added parent farm name display in field cards for better context
- **Benefits**:
  - More efficient use of space in the field cards
  - Clearer information hierarchy with better visual organization
  - Improved user experience with properly positioned action buttons
  - Better context with parent farm name displayed prominently

### 3. Enhanced Crop Management
- **Issue**: The crop management system lacked categorization, field grouping by farm, and automatic harvest date calculation.
- **Solution**:
  - Added crop type categorization (vegetables, fruits, cereals, flowers)
  - Implemented filtering of crops based on selected category
  - Added a crop_type column to the database
  - Grouped fields by farm in the field selection dropdown
  - Added automatic calculation of expected harvest date based on planting date and crop growing duration
  - Made the harvest date editable for user adjustments
- **Benefits**:
  - Easier crop selection through logical categorization
  - Better organization of fields by showing which farm they belong to
  - Time-saving through automatic harvest date calculation
  - Improved user experience with a more logical form flow

### 4. Crop Details and Status Management
- **Issue**: After adding a crop, there was no way to view details, update status, or delete it.
- **Solution**:
  - Created a CropDetailsDialog component to display comprehensive crop information
  - Implemented an UpdateCropStatusForm component for status changes
  - Added View, Edit, and Delete buttons to the crop listing
  - Made the View button open the details dialog
  - Made the Edit button open the same dialog focused on status update
  - Enhanced the Delete functionality with proper confirmation
- **Benefits**:
  - Complete crop lifecycle management
  - Easy status updates as crops progress through growth stages
  - Better data organization with detailed view of crop information
  - Improved user control over crop data

### 5. Fields Page Loading and Authentication Improvements
- **Issue**: The Fields page sometimes failed to load fields properly, and authentication toasts appeared on browser minimize/refresh.
- **Solution**:
  - Added better error handling and retry logic to the fields query
  - Improved farm selection logic to ensure a farm is always selected when available
  - Added force refetch when the component mounts
  - Added an isInitialAuthCheck flag to track when the app is first loading
  - Removed automatic toast messages from auth state changes
  - Only show toast messages for explicit user actions
- **Benefits**:
  - More reliable data loading with proper error handling
  - Smoother user experience with fewer unnecessary notifications
  - Proper UI updates when data changes
  - Less intrusive authentication process

### 6. Field Management Accessibility
- **Issue**: Adding fields required navigating to the Fields page, creating extra steps for users.
- **Solution**:
  - Added "Add Field" buttons in multiple locations:
    - Next to "View Details" on the Farms page
    - In the fields tab of the farm details dialog
  - Ensured the farm is pre-selected when adding a field from these locations
  - Added proper query invalidation to refresh field lists after adding
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced number of steps needed to add a field
  - More intuitive workflow for farm and field management
  - Consistent user experience across different entry points
  - Improved data consistency with proper refreshing
