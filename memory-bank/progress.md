2025-04-14 12:34:47 - Dummy data analysis: Found dedicated dummy data in src/data/mockData.ts (e.g. 'demo-farm-01', ['/placeholder.svg']), as well as a notable placeholder image usage in src/pages/Market.tsx. Multiple UI components across pages (Signup, Login, Settings, etc.) contain hardcoded placeholder texts commonly used for user prompts.
2025-04-14 12:42:45 - Production data integration: All dummy data has been replaced with production data from Supabase.
