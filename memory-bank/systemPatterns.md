The project employs a modular architecture, leveraging a component-based structure in the front-end built with React (TypeScript) and Vite as the build tool. The backend is powered by Supabase, which offers robust data storage and real-time functionality. This separation of concerns is evident in the organized directory structure, where distinct modules exist for crops, livestock, fields, equipment, finances, and more, facilitating maintainability and scalability.
